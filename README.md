Berkeley Bootcamp - Module 5

## Project Overview
Use data visualization techniques to give insight into the data from a ride sharing company called PyBer.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

## Challenge Overview
Youâ€™ve been asked by your CEO to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. In addition to your scatter and pie charts, she would like to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

## Challenge Summary
1. Write a summary in your README.md file for the data in the summary DataFrame.

- The dataframe summary for ridesharing tells us a number of things. There are significantly more rides in Urban cities than Suburban or Rural. The number of drivers also follows that same pattern with more drivers being in Urban cities. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver are actally most expensive in the rural areas and cheaper in the Urban cities.  This tells us that as a ride share service has more drivers available the ride expenses or fares become cheaper on average. However, it is interesting to note that a missing piece of crucial data is the length of the ride. Its possible that since rural areas might require longer rides, that the data is skewed by the duration of the ride causing an increase in fares.

2. Write a summary in your README.md file on what the multiple line graph tells you about the fares for each city type over time.

- The multiline graph gives a nice visualiation of the ride share data. It clearly shows that all city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) are fairly consistent in total fares over time. There are a few spikes in the data here and there but overall quite consistent. It also shows that the majority of the money comes from Urban cities followed by Suburban and Rural last... It is clear from both of the summary dataframe and graph that even though the average fair of a Rural ride is higher, more money is made from Urban rides in total.
