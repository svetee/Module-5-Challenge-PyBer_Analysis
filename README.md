## Challenge Overview

The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an overview comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban cities. The summary demonstrates that there is a larger demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. 

## Results 

Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities. The figure below highlights how rides in Urban cities contributed the most to PyBer's overall rides during this five-month period.

Similarly, we can see a larger volume of drivers in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities. The figure below depicts the significance of drivers in urban cities during this time period.

With a higher demand for PyBer in urban cities, the total fares are consequently also higher than suburban and rural cities. PyBer transactions in urban cities totaled nearly $40,000 while transactions in urban cities and rural cities were at least $19,000 and $4,000, respectively. The majority of PyBer's revenue occurred during this time period: urban cities.

Riders in rural cities pay on average almost $10 more for PyBer than riders in urban cities. The average fare per ride is about $35 in rural cities whereas the average fare per ride is about $25 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per ride is at about $31. The average fare per driver is about $55 in rural areas, whereas the average fare per driver is about $17 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per driver is about $40.

The multiple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type" shows the PyBer Summary DataFrame by providing trends. The yellow line shows how fares in urban cities varied from around $1,600 to $2,300 throughout the data period. The blue line shows how fares in rural cities are around $300 on average during the same time period. The orange trend shows how the total fares in suruban cities is around $700 to $1,300. All charts show similar peak times.

## Challenge Summary


Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. The costs for using PyBer is greater among riders in rural cities than urban cities. This could discourage potential riders from using PyBer given the high average fare per ride. It might be worth to invest in marketing and ways to get new customers through welcome promotions. 
2. Another opprtunity to understand the rural context is to further analyzeother factors that are contributing to the high ride costs in rural cities and low driver fares in urban cities. Perhaps, travel distance is a key factor. If that's the case, could the cost per driven mile be lowered in rural areas? 
3. Understand seasonal needs of customers and adjust prices based on demand.
